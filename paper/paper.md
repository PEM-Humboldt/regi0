# Summary
`regi0` (pronounced re-hyoh) is a Python library to complement and verify existing geographic and taxonomic
information from biological records. Relying on user-provided data or third party APIs, it offers functions
to extract information based on each record's scientific name and coordinates. Furthermore, `regi0` provides 
a verification function that compares existing values in a dataset with extracted (*i.e.* expected) values, 
flagging the records that do not match and adding new suggested values.
