# Summary
`regi0` (pronounced re-hyoh) is a Python library to complement and verify existing geographic and taxonomic
information from biological records. Relying on user-provided data or third party APIs, it offers functions
to extract information (*e.g.* country of occurrence or higher-level taxonomic classification) based on each
record's coordinates and scientific name. Furthermore, `regi0` provides a verification function that compares 
existing values in a dataset with extracted (*i.e.* expected) ones, flagging those records that do not match
and adding new suggested values. `regi0` aims to give its users the ability to complete datasets and create 
flexible verification workflows in order to assess their quality before carrying out further analysis or 
uploading them to biodiversity information repositories.
