CLI
===

regi0 has a command line interface (CLI) that provides two flexible and predefined verification workflows: geographic and taxonomic. These workflows rely on several functions from regi0 but also from local data that the users can download from the `release <https://github.com/PEM-Humboldt/regi0/releases>`_ or provide it themselves.

The CLI is installed alongside with regi0. However, to start using it, it must be :doc:`configured <configuration>` first. After that, the geographic workflow can be executed using the :doc:`geo <geo>` command and the taxonomic workflow can be executed using the :doc:`tax <tax>` command.
